          "text": "Since I’ve returned from my adventure in Palau, I’ve had to face the reality of applying to jobs. However, this did not take up all of my time and I found myself stuck with a lot of free time.\n\nThat free time ended up being used to explore a lot of the aspects of front-end design and development. I was messing around with ReactJS when I started thinking about making a personal website. I had the (what I think to be very funny) idea to recreate my PDF resume as if it was opened in Chrome, but I wanted to make it interactive. I realized that, because of its heavy use of components, ReactJS would be the perfect tool to use for this project. My life began to compose itself of job applications, front-end development, and my daily routine of sleeping, eating, and singing.\n\nA few weeks later, I overheard a family-friend talking about his Agriculture Consulting company.  Out of curiosity, I asked if they had a website, and he said (very hesitantly) that they had a site created through GoDaddy’s website builder. He started to explain that most of his clients tend to be living in very rural areas, and don’t use the computer that much, so he hasn’t had the need to invest in a better site. However, he said it would be nice for his larger more business-oriented clients, or for new clients who are searching online.\n\nWe started talking to about his competition, and he started listing a few companies and sent me their websites. I tried opening them in my phone but none of them were mobile-friendly. I knew instantly that there was an opportunity here.\n\nAs we started talking more, I realized that I had the chance to share my talents with him, and save him a bunch of money that other developers would probably charge.\n\nAbout a month later, I found myself working on websites for a podcast, a camp reunion, a fantasy football game, and of course, the Agriculture Consulting company. While it’s nothing official, I’ve stumbled my way into starting a website consulting business.\n\nThe projects that I am working on are still in progress, and therefore I cannot release pictures from most of them, but I have included pictures of the Agriculture Company’s current website, compared to one of the early prototypes delivered to the client.",

          "text": "As I was taking 67-373, my professor Joseph Mertz gave a short talk about the Technology Consulting in the Global Community (TC in the GC) program. When he started describing past projects and the effects that past students had had, I knew that I would regret not applying for the program. Then about two weeks before graduation, I received an email saying that I had been accepted, and that I would be flying out to Palau a week after I graduated.\n\nI spent the summer of 2017 working for Palau's Ministry of Education. The project itself involved revitalizing the system for teacher observations, which was previously all paper/excel based.\n\nI spent the first few weeks analyzing the process and trying to find an existing solution that could be used to solve their problem. However, after these few weeks and discussion with the teaching specialists, the managers, and the tech support, every existing solution was too large and not catered enough to their needs. So, despite the tradeoff of immediate sustainability, it was decided that a custom full-stack solution would be the best approach for this project.\n\nI spent the rest of the summer developing a Ruby on Rails solution due to my experience in the language and the speed in which development can happen. It was quite the challenge though, as I was developing an entire full-stack web application in 6 weeks, and so I developed the front-end and back-end simultaneously. I started the front-end by using a static template and then plugging in aspects of material design and linking the controllers. The back-end was run using a MySQL database to match what is currently used in the different MoE servers. Then in the last week, it was a mad dash to ensure that the server could get up and running. I spent most of those nights integrating the application with the current log-in server that was run at the MoE and finally served it off of Apache with a day to spare. The project itself also has the basis to be built upon for future expansion and will be worked on by CMU student-consultants in the following four years.\n\nOutside of working for the MoE, I got the chance to become certified in scuba diving while also overcoming one of the greatest fears of my early life: water. I almost drowned a few times when I was little, and therefore I didn’t learn how to swim until I was 12. I still hate the feeling of water on my face and felt completely vulnerable under water. So taking this opportunity allowed me to confront that fear. I can proudly say that I am a certified PADI Open-Water Diver, and without the TC in the GC program, I would never have had the chance.\n\nThis experience was amongst the greatest in my life. Nothing can really compare to flying halfway around the world and getting the chance to affect the education system of an entire country. I will truly remember this for the rest of my life.",

All of the computer science courses that I was taking had us building more and just doing things that I considered to be a lot more fun. But when I finally took this course with Prof. Heimann, I knew that this was the major for me. That’s why I was extremely excited when I was offered the chance to be a Teaching Assistant for this course.\n\nBeing a TA involved three main responsibilities: grading exams and projects, running labs, and proctoring exams. \n\nBefore I actually started working, I felt as if I didn’t know enough to actually teach these students. But after the first lab started, I realized that I knew way more than I thought I did about programming and helping students debug and understand their code.

It’s safe to say that I didn’t go back.\n\nFast forwarding about a decade, my mom brings BCC up again because a new person is running the camp: a guy that my parents had met in Germany while he was touring with a band called Captive Free. The spring semester was coming to a close, and I needed a summer job, so I decided to apply and pretty soon I was hired.\n\nI worked as a camp counselor for 2 full summers (2014 and 2015). The responsibilities included being responsible for a different group of children every week between the ages of 8 and 18 for 8 weeks. This would also involve taking those children out into the woods at least once every week.\n\nIn 2016, I worked for the summer's two busiest weeks, immediately following studying abroad in Dresden.\nIn 2017, I worked for the summer's final week, immediately following working in Palau.\n\nMany interviewers ask me why I would choose to work at a summer camp over a summer internship, but I would easily make the same choice again. I learned a lot while working at BCC. It’s actually surprising that there is so much overlap between being a counselor and a project manager. You’re constantly on a schedule, while constantly handling twenty odd things coming at you at any given time. I really believe that if you can take twenty 10 year olds out into the woods and not only have them survive, but also have fun, then you can manage any project.",
